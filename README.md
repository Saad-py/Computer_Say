# Computer Say

A copy of cowsay in linux.

Instead of a cow it is a computer 

In rust we need to use std::env to get the command line arguments 

To run install the code using `git clone "https://github.com/Saad-py/Computer_Say"`
and then run  `cargo run Computer_Say Hello World`

And then you are done.
